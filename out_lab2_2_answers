Q1: (cin only) What happens when you run the code above? Explain why
Answer Q1: First you enter 10 and it accepts but then you enter 4.5 and it does not accept but the program continues to run.

Q2: (cin + fail+ignore) What happens when you run the code above? Explain why.
Answer Q2: It lets you do what you did the first time but it does tell you fail twice once after you enter abc and presents a message that you haven't entered an integer. Also it let's you know what it ignored including the .5 at the end of the 4.5. It does this because the for loop is reading the array and determining anything that is not an integer and ignoring it but keeping everything else. 

Q3: Is the problem of reading an integer value solved? Explain your reasoning.
Answer Q3: Yes becuase it can take the integer value of an number based string and ignore other things 

Q4: (getline only) What happens when you run the code above? Explain why.
Answer Q4: It accepts all the inputs up until abc which is not an integer so it terminates your code because you entered an invalid argument.

Q5: (getline+stoi) What happens when you run the code above? Explain why.
Answer Q5: It accepted every value given but put any invalid arguments 

Q6: Explain your method to validate integer values entered
Answer Q6: It simply set up a condition
